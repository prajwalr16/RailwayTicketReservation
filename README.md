# üöÜ Railway Ticket Reservation API  

A **Django-based** Railway Ticket Reservation system that manages **ticket booking, RAC allocation, and waiting lists** while enforcing **berth constraints and concurrency handling**.  

## üìå Features  
- **Berth Allocation:** Automatically assigns available berths based on priority rules.  
- **RAC Management:** Allocates RAC (Reservation Against Cancellation) slots when confirmed berths are full.  
- **Waitlist Handling:** Places passengers on the waitlist if RAC is also full.  
- **Priority Rules:**  
   - Senior citizens (60+) and ladies with children get priority for lower berths.  
   - RAC passengers are assigned side-lower berths.  
- **Concurrency Handling:** Ensures no overbooking using database transactions.  
- **REST API Endpoints:** Supports **booking, cancellation, and ticket status retrieval**.  
- **Dockerized Deployment:** Run the entire application seamlessly with Docker.

### Key Components:
1. **Client (Browser):** Users interact with the system through a web interface or API clients.
2. **REST API Endpoints:** Django-based endpoints handle requests for booking, cancellation, and ticket status.
3. **Business Logic Layer:** Implements berth allocation, RAC, waitlist management, and concurrency handling.
4. **Database Layer:** Stores passenger details, ticket statuses, and berth availability using SQLite.
5. **Dockerized Services:** Ensures seamless deployment and scalability with Docker Compose.

## üöÄ Quick Start (Using Docker)  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/prajwalr16/RailwayTicketReservation.git
cd RailwayTicketReservation
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Build and Run the Docker Container  
```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d --build
